# Hello Vue 3

In this tutorial, we are going to get an early look at Vue 3. You might have heard about the composition API by now but in this lesson, you are going to get some hands-on experience using it.

To get started we are going to build a simple example in Vue 2. From there we will clone the Vue 3 repository (which is currently in pre-alpha status) and build a runtime. From there we will drop the runtime on to a simple HTML page and convert the Vue 2 example over to Vue 3.

While this is a simple example it will give us a chance to work with the composition API by actually using Vue 3.
